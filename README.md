In order to run our code you will need python 3 and pip
Using pip, install tk, pillow, and psycopg2

So far to run the code we just use 'python gui.py' or 'py -3 gui.py'

To test for player_ID, in the first box (from the left) type in a player_ID and hit the 'Save' button. This will give a message in the terminal window if there is a player with that ID in DB.
If there is, then a popup box will prompt you for equipment_ID and autofill the player's name.
If there isn't, then a window will ask for a codename (playername).
