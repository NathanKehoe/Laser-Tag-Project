"# Laser-Tag-Project" 
So far to run the code we just use python gui.py or py -3 gui.py
To test for player_ID, in the first box (from the left) type in a player_ID and hit the 'Save' button. This will give a message in the terminal window if there is a player with that ID in DB.
If there is, then a popup box will prompt you for equipment_ID.
